- create connections between roads
- ???? Road - find a way to connect a vehicle to a lane, when multiple lanes are on a section of the road.
- review the level of details involved in the simulator. Is agressivity needed for example?
- consider crossing intersection on the left side - yield to vehicles comming from front, manage with vehicles comming from front taking left turn
- implement right turn on red light (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on_red) with yield to left traffic
- add obstacle to right turns, for pedestrians
- use a linked list instead of vector. That way we can keep vehicles sorted and we don't have to sort the lane at each time step

15.11 - DONE - Add semaphores
11.11 - DONE - Create multiple lanes tests - 3, 4 etc
11.11 - DONE - Add lane change logic
09.14 - DONE - Create a test with more lanes
09.07 - DONE - Make some sort of vehicle selection in python view. When a vehicle is selected by a mouse click, show it's info

09.04 - DONE - Don't let vehicles pass through each other (decelerate when another vehicle is in front and passing over is not possible)

09.05 - DONE - Add 2 or more vehicles to a road

08.31 - DONE - have simulator data into some text format so python views can handle it
      - DONE - collect simple road test output from testmap.cpp into a file and feed it into simple_road.py for testing.
        DONE - Then continue with 2, 3 and more cars on a single lane road
